# Object Detection Scenario Documentation

ML-Wrappers supports model wrapping of Pytorch object detection methods. We convert the model to a function by either using the predict_proba function, or, if it is not available, the predict function. 

To do 

```
_major = '0'
_minor = <enter new minor version here>
_patch = <enter new patch version here>
```
